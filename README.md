# ENCRYPTION-DECRYPTION-OF-AUDIO-SIGNALS-Using-MATLAB
This is a novel method for encrypting and decrypting the voice or audio signals, thereby increasing the security of the signal. It is based on an asymmetric key generation algorithm called Diffie-Hellman Algorithm. . This robust algorithm firstly cyphers the input audio signal, followed by encrypting the same signal and adding that extra layer of safety. In case the encrypted signal and secret have been leaked in the public channel, the signal when decrypted gives us the cyphered signal, which is different from the original audio signal. As the possibility of output decrypted signal doesnâ€™t guarantee the original signal persists, due to the addition of noise whilst it is transmitted through the public channel, it becomes a necessity to pass it through a filter to get the desired output.
